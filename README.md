# Express Backend & Project Management Assignment

## Overview

This repository is designed as a part of a technical assignment to demonstrate the ability to build backend services using Express.js, coupled with effective project management practices using GitHub tools. It includes implementations of backend APIs for managing "Cats" and "TODO" resources, demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The project is structured to reflect real-world development processes, including the use of issues, branches, commits, pull requests (PRs), and a project board for task management and tracking.

## Repository Structure

- **`/controllers`**: Contains controller files that define functions for handling requests for different routes.
- **`/routes`**: Includes router files that direct API requests to the appropriate controller functions.
- **`index.js`**: The entry point for the Express application.

## Features

### Cats Module
The Cats module allows users to:
- Create a new cat record.
- Retrieve all cat records.
- Update existing cat records.
- Delete cat records.

### TODO Module
The TODO module enables users to:
- Add a new TODO item.
- View all TODO items.
- Update the status and details of an existing TODO.
- Delete a TODO item.

## Tools Used

- **Express.js**: Framework used to build the API.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the backend.
- **Postman**: Testing tool for API endpoints.

## Project Management

- **GitHub Projects**: Used for tracking progress through a Kanban board.
- **Issues**: Each task is tracked as a separate issue.
- **Milestones**: Group related issues for significant features or phases.
- **Feature Branches and PRs**: Development is done in feature branches, which are merged into the main branch through pull requests.
